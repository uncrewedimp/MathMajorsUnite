# Run the Website

### Steps:

1. Make sure you've pulled the latest version of the repo
2. Make sure you've installed django (`pip install django`)
3. Navigate to `cs340_project` directory
4. Run `python3 manage.py runserver`
  - You should now see some output to the console; this is setting up a local server.
5. Copy and paste the server URL (should be on the line: `Starting Development server at ...`)
  - URL will probably be `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

You'll now be able to navigate around the website.
